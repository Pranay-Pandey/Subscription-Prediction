# Subscription-Prediction

Companies these days have the opportunity to develop sophisticated predictive models to boost their sales and make better marketing plans. Thanks to the increasing amount of data being created by people online, companies have an almost bottom-less pool of critical information. But not all of it is relevant. It takes a lot of effort to sift through all that data, figure out what's relevant and what's not, and then put all the relevant data to work and create a marketing plan. But Machine Learning can make this process a lot easier.

A Machine Learning model designed here is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not.
